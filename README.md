Nomado ‚Äî Secure Identity for the Smart Traveler
Offline. Encrypted. Under your full control.

1. The Problem
Every traveler carries sensitive documents everywhere ‚Äî passports, insurance papers, medical records.

Losing them abroad means chaos, exposure, and identity risk.

Most ‚Äúdigital wallets‚Äù depend on the cloud and centralized databases, which makes privacy impossible.

Governments take years to change ID regulations ‚Äî but travelers need safety now.

We asked: if not passports, what else causes the same pain ‚Äî loss, exposure, stress?

2. The Concept
Nomado protects and simplifies travel documentation without changing any law.

It‚Äôs a privacy-first hardware system:

The Nomado Card, a personal encrypted identity for health and insurance data.
The Nomado Kiosk, a secure station where cards are created and verified.
Together, they form a bridge between travelers, hospitals, and insurers ‚Äî offline, encrypted, and trusted.

3. The Solution
Nomado stores verified medical and insurance data directly on the card, not online.

Access requires the traveler‚Äôs fingerprint ‚Äî used only to create a cryptographic key (never stored).

If the card is lost, it‚Äôs unreadable.

If used, it unlocks life-saving information instantly.

Offline by design. Private by principle.

For Travelers: Carry verified health and insurance data securely, accessible anywhere.
For Hospitals: Instantly verify patient identity and medical history.
For Insurers: Simplify claims and reduce fraud.
Nomado doesn‚Äôt replace existing systems ‚Äî it connects them safely.

4. How It Works
Traveler registers at a Nomado Kiosk (in a clinic or insurance office).
Their verified data is encrypted directly onto the Nomado Card.
When needed abroad, hospitals can verify identity and essential health info offline, through a secure Nomado Terminal.
Fingerprint unlocks access temporarily ‚Äî no data leaves the card.
No internet. No cloud. No risk.

5. The Impact
Nomado transforms travel anxiety into peace of mind.

For Travelers:

Confidence that data is safe even if the card is lost.
Calm knowing hospitals can treat them correctly and securely.
For Hospitals:

Faster, safer patient intake with verified data.
Fewer errors and less admin work.
For Insurers:

Secure claim verification.
Reduced fraud and compliance overhead.
Nomado gives people control over their data ‚Äî and hospitals the trust to use it responsibly.

6. Business Model
Key Partners:

Hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centers, insurers, and certification authorities.

Key Activities:

Hardware production (kiosks, cards), encryption and software development, compliance maintenance.

Value Proposition:

Protect patients from data misuse and empower trusted institutions to use it responsibly.

Customer Segments:

Travelers, hospitals, and insurance providers.

Channels:

B2B partnerships and institutional sales.

Revenue Streams:

Card issuance via insurers/clinics and annual subscriptions for compliance updates.

7. Conclusion
To be the physical bridge between today‚Äôs travelers and tomorrow‚Äôs digital identity.

Nomado represents a decentralized, human-centered approach to privacy ‚Äî

a future where every traveler moves freely and safely, with trust built into every trip.

8. Mission Statement
Nomado exists to make travel safer, calmer, and truly private.

If you lose the card ‚Äî it‚Äôs just plastic.

But when you use it ‚Äî it‚Äôs your world, protected.
